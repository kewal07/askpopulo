				Prediction games are a special type of question where users can predict the answer of the question beforehand by adding some pCoins. At the end when the question times out, if the option which the user had predicted gets the maximum number of answers or is a winner based on an actual event, the user gets more pCoins in return based on our internal calculation algorithm. For e.g. if the user adds 100 pCoins on Option A of the prediction question and Option A gets maximum answers when it has timed out in that case user would get pCoins greater than 100 which is calculated using our internal algorithm.
